Note: Since this project makes use of both JavaFX and Maven, I took your (professor's) advice given in your
"Getting Started with Maven" video and changed the version of the JDK from 14 to 1.8, one more hospitable to JavaFX.
If it doesn't immediately run, you may need to change the version of your compiler to 1.8 or vice versa.
